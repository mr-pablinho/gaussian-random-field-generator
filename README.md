# Gaussian random field generator using Cholesky decomposition

Gaussian random fields are useful in many practical applications. For instance, hydrogeology and material sciences. I am sure there is a script out there but I was not able to find it. So, I created this one.

As the name shows, a Gaussian random field is a random field involving Gaussian (a.k.a. Normal distributed) probability density functions of the variables.

There is a Jupyter notebook that can be used by anyone to understand what is going on, and also collaborate to optimize, correct and include new algorithms. Please, let me know if you find mistakes or you have any feedback.
